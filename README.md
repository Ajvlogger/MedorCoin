# MedorCoin
MedorCoin is a utility-focused crypto project designed to reward users for everyday digital activities such as watching TV and ads, answering surveys and quizzes, playing games, and spinning daily reward wheels.
Token holders can stake MedorCoin by adding liquidity to supported pools, with the option to lock liquidity through third-party platforms for added security.
Once users reach the required reward threshold, MedorCoin can be sent, swapped for other tokens, transferred to personal wallets, or exchanged for cash via PayPal, digital wallets, or direct deposit (where supported).
As the community grows and platform usage increases, demand for MedorCoin is expected to grow alongside it.
Always do your own research (DYOR).
